Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\n[New]-bent in heaven, shall behold the night\nOf our solemnities|Hyppolyta|Theseus|-
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\nNor how it may concern my modesty\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts;\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius|Hermia|Theseus|-
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him.\nAnd she is mine, and all my right of her\nI do estate unto Demetrius.|Egeus|Lysander|-
A very good pieces of work, I assure you, and a\nmerry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your\nactors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.|Bottom|The Rude Mechanicals|-
You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyra-\nmus is a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one\nshall see in a summer's day, a most lovely gentle-\nmanlike man. Therefore you must needs play Pyr-\namus.|Quince|Bottom|-
Have you the lion's part written? Pray you, if it\nbe, give it me, for I am slow of study.|Snug|Quince|-
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day.\nIf you will patiently dance in our round\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us.\nIf not, shun me and I will spare your haunts.|Titania|Oberon|-
I'll put a girdle round about the earth\nin forty minutes.|Robin|Oberon|-
I will not stay thy questions. Let me go,\nOr if thou follow me, do not believe\nBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood.|Demetrius|Helena|-
What thou seest when thou dost wake,\nDo it for thy true love take.\nLove and languish for his sake.\nBe it ounce, or cat, or bear,\nPard, or board with bristled hair,\nIn thy eye that shall appear\nWhen thou wak'st, it is thy dear.\nWake when some vile thing is near [He exits.]|Oberon|Titania|-
"Amen, amen" to that fair prayer, say I,\nAnd then end life when I end loyalty!\nHere is my bed. Sleep give thee all his rest!|Lysander|Hermia|-
O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.|Helena|Lysander|-
Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall\nbe written in eight and six.|Quince|The Rude Mechanicals|-
Why, then, may you leave a casement of the\ngreat chamber window, where we play, open, and\nthe moon may shine in at the casement|Bottom|The Rude Mechanicals
Out of this wood do not desire to go.\nThou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.\nI am a spirit of no common rate.\nThe summer still doth tend upon my state,\nAnd I do love thee. Therefore go with me.\nI'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,\nAnd they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep\nAnd sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep.\nAnd I will purge thy mortal grossness so\nThat thou shalt like an airy spirit go.--\nPeaseblossom, Cobweb, Mote, and Mustardseed!|Titania|Bottom|-
I wonder if Titania be awaked;\nThen what it was that next came in her eye,\nWhich she must dote on in extremity.|Oberon|Robin|-
This is the woman, but not this the man.|Robin|Oberon|-
Get you gone, you dwarf\nYou minimus of hind'ring knotgrass made,\nYou bead, you acorn--|Lysander|Hermia|-
I had rather have a handful or two of dried\npeas. But, I pray you, let none of your people stir\nme; I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.|Bottom|Titania|-
My Oberon, what visions have I seen!\nMethought I was enamored of an ass.|Titania|Oberon|-
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,\nMine own and not mine own.|Helena|The Quartet|-
Have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come\nhome yet?|Quince|The Rude Mechanicals|-
Bottom! O most courageous day! O most hap-\npy hour!|Quince|Bottom|-
Where are these lads? Where are these\nhearts?|Bottom|The Rude Mechanicals|-
Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth.--\nJoy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of love\nAccompany your hearts!|Theseus|Party Guests|-
No, my noble lord,\nIt is not for you. I have heard it over,\nAnd it is nothing, nothing in the world,\nUnless you can find sport in their intents,\nExtremely stretched and conned with cruel pain\To do you service.|Philostrate|Theseus|-
If we shadows have offended,\nThink but this and all is mended:\nThat you have but slumbered here\nWhile these visions did appear.\nAnd this weak and idle theme,\nNo more yielding but a dream,\nGentles, do not reprehend.\nIf you pardon, we will mend.\nAnd, as I am an honest Puck,\nIf we have unearned luck\nNow to 'scape the serpent's tongue,\nWe will make amends ere long.\nElse the Puck a liar call.\nSo good night unto you all.\nGive me your hands, if we be friends,\nAnd Robin shall restore amends.
